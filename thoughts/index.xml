&lt;p&gt;“One of the most prominent objections to SIA concerns Bostrom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;presumptuous philosopher&amp;rsquo; scenario. In this example, the non-anthropic evidence has led scientists to place equal credence on two rival cosmological theories T1 and T2. &amp;lsquo;According to T1 the world is very, very big but finite and there are a total of a trillion trillion observers in the cosmos. According to T2, the world is very, very, very big but finite and there are a trillion trillion trillion observers.&amp;rsquo; Just as the scientists are preparing to run a cheap experiment that will definitively rule out one of the two theories, they are interrupted by a philosopher who believes SIA. He argues that the experiment is a waste of effort as T2 is a trillion times as likely to be true as T1. Bostrom finds this conclusion absurd and believes that it should thoroughly discredit SIA.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
