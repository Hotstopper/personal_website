I used a Markov-switching (MS) model to classify the Bitcoin market into three distinct constant-mean regimes from 2012 to 2025. The results are as follows:

The colours red, grey, and green correspond to bearish, neutral, and bullish return regimes.

I find that periods of low economic uncertainty tend to coincide with bull regimes. This pattern reflects Bitcoinâ€™s role as a risky asset, with investors allocating capital during stable macroeconomic conditions, leading to both higher expected returns and higher volatility, consistent with the MS model results. Such dynamics are compatible with EMH (efficient market hypothesis), as abnormal returns reflect time-varying risk premia rather than market inefficiency.

I overlayed the Bitcoin regimes identified above on 4 broad indicators of economic uncertainity. Probit regressions show that commodity markets significantly explain bull market regimes, and macroeconomic factors jointly explain regime transitions at p<0.01.
