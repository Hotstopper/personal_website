While preparing for the Hong Kong public examination, I built an interactive economics question bank from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

After analysing 11 years of past papers, I categorised questions into 109 types and added a randomisation function to draw questions unpredictably. I used it for spaced repetition by answering five questions a day, ultimately achieving the top grade, 5**, in the final examination.
